        <p>YYC Networks ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. It is intended to meet requirements under Canadian privacy laws (including PIPEDA) and to provide transparency for U.S. users (including disclosures consistent with the CCPA/CPRA where applicable). This site is a simple, static marketing site with a contact form.</p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> When you submit our contact form, we receive the fields you enter (e.g., name, email, message contents, interest type).</li>
          <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Emails you send to us, and our replies.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical (minimal):</strong> Our site is served as static pages (e.g., GitHub Pages). We do not run client-side analytics by default. Hosting providers may log basic technical data (e.g., IP address, browser type, date/time) for security and operational reasons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To respond to inquiries and provide quotes or services you request.</li>
          <li>To operate, maintain, and improve our website and services.</li>
          <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce agreements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Legal bases (Canada/EU-style framing):</strong> We rely on your consent (e.g., submitting a form), our legitimate interests in operating a professional services business, and compliance with applicable law.</p>

        <h2>Sharing and service providers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Form processing:</strong> Our contact form may be processed by Formspree (a third-party form service) to deliver your submission to us via email.</li>
          <li><strong>Hosting/CDN:</strong> The site may be hosted on GitHub Pages or similar static hosts/CDNs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share information with service providers only as necessary to operate the site and respond to you, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not set first-party analytics cookies or trackers by default. If we add analytics or other tools in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, request consent.</p>

        <h2>International transfers</h2>
        <p>Our services and providers may operate in multiple countries, including Canada and the United States. By interacting with us, you understand your information may be processed outside your province/state or country, where laws may differ.</p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>We keep personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described (e.g., responding to inquiries, ongoing client relationships), and to meet legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When no longer needed, we aim to securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical protections appropriate for a small professional services business and the limited data collected. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p><strong>Canada (PIPEDA and similar):</strong> You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information, subject to legal limits. You can also withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</p>
        <p><strong>United States (CCPA/CPRA transparency):</strong> If you are a California resident, you may have rights to access, delete, or obtain a copy of certain personal information and to not be discriminated against for exercising rights. We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising as those terms are defined by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>
        <p>To exercise any rights, please contact us using the email below. We may need to verify your identity and may decline requests where an exemption applies.</p>

        <h2>Children‚Äôs privacy</h2>
        <p>Our services are directed to businesses and adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under the age of majority where you live). If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date above reflects the latest version. Material changes will be highlighted on this page.</p>
