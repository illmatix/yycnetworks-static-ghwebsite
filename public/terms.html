        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of YYC Networks' website and professional services (collectively, the "Services"). By engaging us or using the site, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Services and scope</h2>
        <p>We offer consulting, one‑off projects, and support for existing products, plus a fixed‑price realty website package as described on our site. Each engagement’s scope, deliverables, timeline, and fees will be specified in writing (e.g., proposal, SOW, email confirmation). In case of conflict, the signed proposal or SOW controls.</p>

        <h2>2. Quotes, fees, and payment</h2>
        <p>Quotes are based on the agreed scope and assumptions. Unless otherwise stated, invoices are due within 15 days. Late payments may incur reasonable interest or suspension of work. Taxes, third‑party fees (e.g., IDX/CRM providers), and expenses are your responsibility unless explicitly included.</p>

        <h2>3. Client responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide timely access, information, and decisions necessary to perform the Services.</li>
          <li>Ensure you have rights to any materials you supply (e.g., logos, content, data) and that they comply with applicable laws.</li>
          <li>Designate a point of contact to streamline communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, upon full payment you receive a worldwide, non‑exclusive, perpetual license to use the deliverables for your business. We retain ownership of background IP, tools, frameworks, and know‑how used to deliver the Services. Open‑source components remain subject to their licenses.</p>

        <h2>5. Portfolio and attribution</h2>
        <p>We may reference your name/brand and non‑confidential project details in our portfolio and marketing. If you prefer not to be listed, tell us in writing and we will honor reasonable requests.</p>

        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Each party may disclose confidential information to the other. The receiving party will use it only for the purpose of the engagement and protect it with reasonable care. Confidentiality doesn’t apply to information that is or becomes public through no fault of the receiving party, is independently developed, or is rightfully received from a third party.</p>

        <h2>7. Warranties and disclaimers</h2>
        <p>We will perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry practice for similar services. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED, THE SERVICES AND SITE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. EXCEPT FOR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OR BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR IP RIGHTS, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICES IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your materials, your misuse of the Services, or your violation of law or these Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>Either party may terminate an engagement for convenience with written notice (subject to any agreed cancellation terms) or for cause if the other party materially breaches and does not cure within a reasonable period. Upon termination, you will pay for Services performed and non‑cancelable commitments through the effective date.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing law and venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws rules. The exclusive venue for any disputes is the courts located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.</p>
        <p>For U.S. users: you are responsible for compliance with U.S. laws applicable to your use of the Services. If any provision is unenforceable in your jurisdiction, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date above reflects the latest version. Material changes will be posted on this page.</p>
